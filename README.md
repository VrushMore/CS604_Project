# Project_CS604
Our aim in this project is to create a traditional 32-bit MIPS processor with a 5-stage  pipeline. using   the essential code and design skills from   the text from "David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design ARM edition" as well as the material from this course's earlier modules. 
The descriptions in this book can be used to design our own architecture. A five stage pipeline, including FETCH, DECODE, EXECUTE, MEM, and WB, would be used for implementation. 
After putting in place the pipeline, apply a to address a data risk.
